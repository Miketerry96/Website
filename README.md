Welcome to my github repository for my personal website!

If you are reading this, I imagine you are either a recruiter, potential collaborator or personal acquaintance. 

I hope that this post-graduation, pre-employment project serves a number of purposes for myself and whoever may inquire. 

This project is the first of many that I hope to complete, as I intend to revisit each programming language I have engaged with in depth. 

Here I cover:
•HTML
•CSS
•PHP
•Javascript

Throughout my time seeking for employment, I hope to continuously update this portfolio with each project I complete. I hope that this serves as a supplement to my programming experience, my resume and my personal enjoyment.

Stay tuned for updates as I am frequently adding new features and modifying old ones.

Thanks for checking it out!
